        <h1>Week 4 Notes</h1>
        <p>Monday/2021</p>
        <p>
            Met with Brother Blazzard to discuss my progress in this class and my acedemic progress overall.
        </p>
        <p>Met with John Stavast who had agreed to look at my code to see if he could see why I could get it to run in
            html but not as a seperate file. Turns out I had put the link in the head instead of late in the body.
            Lesson Learned.</p>
        <p>Read from chapter 8 about forms. I am finding that this author is unclear aoub which code he is using in the
            examples he explains. He mentions multiple versions of a code line and uses some of them but I am not sure
            which are used and which are only mentioned. As the discussion continues, some of the code is changed or
            removed but he is unclear about which code is kept or changed. I believe that I am understanding the
            concepts but following the coding examples is tedious and I find myself forced to figure out how to make his
            examples work. I worked as far as Retrieving and Changing Values from a Form section.</p>
        <p> Tuesday /2021</p>
        <p>Reviewed the team activity and experimented with creating the grid with both the div and table method. </p>
        <p>The code example explanations in JNtoN are difficult to follow because I sometimes cannot tell which code is being used and which code is merely being mentioned. I am going to use the MDN tutorial about forms to learn about them. Searched for Codepens of tic tac toe games to see approaches that have been created. The first one that I found made me realize that I do not understand the coding concepts very well q            that I have been reviewing.</p>
        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form">MDN Form Turtorial</a></p>
        <p>Form controls make up forms and are sometimes called widgets.</p>
        <p>start by designing the form. Design for a best user experience. Determine which info is needed from the user and limit the form to the basic needs.</p>
        <p>Assistive technologies work best when widget and their labels are nested in a single label. </p>
