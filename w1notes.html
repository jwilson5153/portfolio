        <p> Read through the syllabus. Had issues getting the email from the book store for the access to Sitepoint. Took three phone calls and until Tuesday afternoon to get the email. Downloaded the DS ebook and looked to see the other books mentioned. Already had a Github account so added the repository for this portfolio.

        <p>Created the basic html, css, js, and json files for the portfolio.</p>
        <p>Not able to log in to the Microsoft Team app that I have downloaded. Keep getting a 401 error. Opened a ticket with Support.</p>

        <p>Master Mobile UX - Starting in 2007 the existance of small, mobile devices began rapidly increasing in number. Today there are a large number of different devices with a variety of screen sizes and resolutions. Mobile first design is the best way to create a superior user experience. Desktop computer sales are declining. Availability if decreasing. Concentrate on content and functionality first. Mobile First Design Strategy  - Be there - Be useful - Be quick (reduce cognitive load)- Reachabilty - Speed matters (loading times) - Networks matter - Reduce image size SVG/Webfonts Optimize and minify CSS and JS and GZIP files. Put primary controls in the easy to reach areas. Use "Menu" within a border and looking lika button is best UX. Put labels as float label inside of the input box on forms and get rid of not required boxes. Limit the amount of input needed bu simplifying the input process. Paginate long forms and add a progress indicator and use autocomplete.</p>
