        <h1>Week 3 Notes</h1>
        <p>Monday 5/3/2021</p>
        <p>Read the articles about the "this" object method. I understand it a little but need to use it to better
            explore it.
        </p>
        <p> Tuesday 5/4/2021</p>
        <p>Completed the chpt 5 reading about objects. I did play with the coding for some of the concepts. I can say
            that I "understand" but there is so much there that only a little of it is tightly in my understanding and
            memory.</p>
        <p>Reading chpt 6 about the DOM. The Level 0 methods are interesting in that a full list of a particular element
            type can be created and that list formed into an array for further use. </p>
        <p>Wednesday 5/5/2021</p>
        <p>Completed reading of chpt 6 and did some code practice. I am attempting to set up my portfolio page to use
            localStorage. I can see that I am repeating code but do not yet understand how to combine correctly. Need to
            review and improve what I have completed thus far.</p>
            <p>Worked with group 5 on the group assignment. The collaboration was helpful. We all three had input for the 5 tasks. We did not have time to attempt the stretch tasks. I had wathed the Wes Boz video and learned but actually doing the coding helped with learning the concepts. One concept that I picked up from Wes was to use console.table which really makes array output look better.</p>
